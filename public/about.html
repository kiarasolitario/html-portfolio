<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm currently a third year Information Systems student. While I'm studying in hybrid mode, I am also working on another course on becoming a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>

<p>My only work experience is 16 months in McDonald's. At the moment, I'm about to 
  design a website for my client on his business. 
</p>

<p>I would be so proud of myself if I finish this course :3.</p>
